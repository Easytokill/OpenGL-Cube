OpenGL-Cube
===========

Very simple OpenGL project that makes a pretty, rotating, cube, and allows the user to change the rotation speed and axis.

It has the VBO, EBO, VAO, window, and shader initialization pullled out of the main function,
which proved to be slightly more difficult than expected.

This project was made simply because I realized I had no code to proove that I knew how code using OpenGL
(also because I wanted to see what a cube that colorfull would look like)
